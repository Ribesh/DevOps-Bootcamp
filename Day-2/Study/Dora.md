# Dora and DORA Metrics

## What is Dora?
Dora stands for **DevOps Research and Assessment**. It is a framework used to measure and improve software development and delivery performance. Dora helps teams understand how well they deliver software and identify areas for improvement.

## What are DORA Metrics?
DORA defines **four key metrics** that measure software delivery performance:

1. **Deployment Frequency**  
   - How often your team deploys code to production.  
   - Higher frequency usually indicates faster delivery.

2. **Lead Time for Changes**  
   - Time it takes from code being committed to running in production.  
   - Shorter lead time means quicker delivery of features and fixes.

3. **Change Failure Rate**  
   - Percentage of deployments that cause failures in production.  
   - Lower rate indicates more reliable releases.

4. **Time to Restore Service (MTTR)**  
   - Time it takes to recover from a failure in production.  
   - Shorter recovery time means better reliability and resilience.

## Benefits of DORA Metrics
- **Improves software delivery speed** by identifying bottlenecks.  
- **Enhances reliability** by tracking failures and recovery time.  
- **Data-driven decisions** help teams focus on real improvements.  
- **Better collaboration** between development and operations teams.  

## Challenges of DORA Metrics
- **Data collection can be hard** if tools and processes are not in place.  
- **Metrics can be misinterpreted** if used without context.  
- **Focus on metrics alone** can harm team morale or encourage shortcuts.  
- **Requires cultural change** to act on insights and improve continuously.  

## Conclusion
DORA metrics are a simple but powerful way to measure and improve DevOps performance. They help teams deliver software faster, more reliably, and with better quality. However, organizations must use them wisely and focus on improvement, not just numbers.
