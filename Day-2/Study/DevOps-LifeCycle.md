# DevOps Life Cycle

The **DevOps Life Cycle** is a set of practices that combines **software development (Dev)** and **IT operations (Ops)** to deliver software faster, more reliably, and efficiently. It focuses on **automation, collaboration, and continuous improvement**.

## Stages of DevOps Life Cycle

1. **Planning**  
   - Define project goals, requirements, and features.  
   - Create a roadmap for development and deployment.

2. **Coding**  
   - Developers write code using best practices and version control (e.g., Git).  
   - Code is modular, testable, and ready for deployment.

3. **Building**  
   - Convert code into executable files or packages.  
   - Continuous Integration (CI) tools like Jenkins automate builds.

4. **Testing**  
   - Automated tests check code quality, functionality, and security.  
   - Detects bugs before deployment.

5. **Release**  
   - Prepare code for deployment to production environments.  
   - Continuous Delivery (CD) ensures safe and reliable releases.

6. **Deployment**  
   - Deploy code to production for users.  
   - Can be automated with tools like Docker, Kubernetes, or Ansible.

7. **Operations / Monitoring**  
   - Monitor performance, availability, and errors in production.  
   - Tools like Prometheus, Grafana, or ELK stack are used.

8. **Feedback / Continuous Improvement**  
   - Collect user feedback and performance data.  
   - Improve features, fix bugs, and optimize processes continuously.

## Key Benefits
- Faster software delivery  
- Higher quality and reliability  
- Better collaboration between teams  
- Quick response to issues and user feedback  

## Conclusion
The DevOps Life Cycle is a continuous loop that emphasizes **automation, collaboration, and feedback**. It helps organizations deliver software efficiently and improve continuously.
