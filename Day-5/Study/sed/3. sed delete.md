# Sed Delete
> We’ll explore how to delete lines from input files using the `d` command, covering non-destructive edits, specific-line removals, range deletions, and in-place updates.

## Overview of the d Command

The simplest way to remove lines in sed is with the delete script d:

```bash
sed 'd' employees.txt
```

Output:
```bash
```

> This command reads every line and deletes it, **producing no output**.

## Non-Destructive Deletion

```bash
sed '2d' employees.txt
```

Output:
```bash
