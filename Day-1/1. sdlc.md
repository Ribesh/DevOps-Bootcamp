# SDLC: Waterfall, Agile & DevOps


## 1. SDLC
**SDLC (Software Development Life Cycle)** = the steps to **plan, build, test, deploy, and maintain** software.

Common phases: Requirements → Design → Development → Testing → Deployment → Maintenance

---

## 2. Waterfall (Traditional Model)

**Idea:** Do everything **step-by-step, once**, in order.

- **Flow:** Requirements → Design → Code → Test → Deploy → Maintain  
- **Traits:**
  - Linear, rigid
  - Heavy documentation
  - Requirements must be clear upfront
- **Pros:**
  - Simple, well-structured
  - Good for fixed, stable projects (e.g., government, regulated)
- **Cons:**
  - Hard to handle changes
  - Bugs/feedback come very late
  - Customer sees working product only at the end

---

## 3. Agile (Modern Iterative Model)

**Idea:** Build software in **small pieces (iterations/sprints)** with **continuous feedback**.

- **Flow (Scrum-style):**
  - Backlog → Sprint Planning → 1–4 week Sprint (Design + Code + Test) → Review → Retrospective
- **Traits:**
  - Iterative, incremental
  - Flexible to changing requirements
  - Close collaboration with customer
- **Pros:**
  - Early and frequent delivery
  - Adapts to change easily
  - Continuous user feedback
- **Cons:**
  - Needs active customer & disciplined team
  - Less upfront documentation
  - Harder to fix exact time/cost early

## 4. Waterfall vs Agile

| Aspect           | Waterfall              | Agile                         |
|------------------|------------------------|-------------------------------|
| Flow             | Linear                 | Iterative                     |
| Change Handling  | Poor                   | Excellent                     |
| Customer Role    | Mostly early           | Continuous                    |
| Testing          | Near the end           | In every iteration            |
| Delivery         | One big release        | Many small releases           |

## 5. DevOps

**DevOps = Culture + Practices + Tools**  
It connects **Development (Dev)** and **Operations (Ops)** to deliver software **faster and more reliably**.

- **Works best with:** **Agile** (not Waterfall)
- **Key ideas:**
  - Collaboration between Dev & Ops
  - Automation of build, test, deploy
  - Continuous Integration (CI)
  - Continuous Delivery/Deployment (CD)
  - Monitoring & feedback from production

**DevOps Lifecycle:**  
Plan → Code → Build → Test → Release → Deploy → Operate → Monitor → (back to Plan)

**Common Tool Areas:**
- Version control (Git)
- CI/CD pipelines
- Containers (Docker), Orchestration (Kubernetes)
- Monitoring & logging (Prometheus, Grafana, etc.)

## 6. How They Relate

- **Waterfall** – old, linear model, good for stable environments.
- **Agile** – modern, flexible way to **manage work and build** software.
- **DevOps** – modern way to **deliver, operate, and improve** software, usually combined with Agile.

> Typical modern setup: **Agile + DevOps + CI/CD**
